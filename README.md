## Professional Profile
- Performance-focused engineer pairing semantic HTML with modern JS frameworks to ship resilient web/mobile products.
- Comfortable building across React, Next.js, Vue, Twig, Expo, React Native, Convex, and Supabase.
- Blend of design systems thinking and product pragmatism—every component is verified for accessibility, responsiveness, and runtime stability.

## Core Competencies
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Vue, Astro/Twig, TypeScript, Chakra UI, Tailwind, design tokens.
- **Mobile:** React Native, Expo Router, gesture-handler, Reanimated, OTA updates, deep linking.
- **Backend & Realtime:** Convex, Supabase (Auth, RLS, storage), Firebase, Zod validation.
- **Quality:** Playwright, Vitest/Jest, Lighthouse, Continuous accessibility testing, performance budgets.
- **Collaboration:** Figma-to-code handoff, RFC writing, scope decomposition, async communication.

## HNG Internship Experience
### Frontend & Mobile Engineer (Stages 0 – 4, 2024 Cohort)
- Partnered with cross-stage mentors to ship seven production-ready builds across React, Vue, Twig, Next.js, Expo, Convex, and Supabase.
- Drove accessibility and performance as acceptance criteria; constrained bundle sizes and network requests per feature.
- Contributed reviews, wrote internal docs, and supported other interns through async debugging sessions.

## Selected Projects
### Multi-page Profile Card · Stage 0 – 1 · HTML/CSS
- Crafted a semantic, multi-page profile with consistent breadcrumbs, skip links, and responsive cards.
- Attained 98+ Lighthouse scores for both Accessibility and Best Practices; zero axe violations.
- Automated Playwright smoke tests cover viewport down to 320px with regression screenshots.

### myTickets Manager · Stage 2 · React/Vue/Twig
- Built CRUD ticket flows in three frameworks using shared design tokens and component contracts.
- Backed all mutations with JSON Schema validation + Faker fixtures to mimic a live API.
- Monitored bundle budgets; each implementation ships under 80 KB gzipped after tree shaking.

### Audiophile E-commerce · Stage 3A · Next.js/Convex/Chakra UI
- Implemented SSR product catalog, cart, and checkout with typed API routes and Convex persistence.
- Followed atomic-design architecture with reusable layout templates and design token driven theming.
- Added transactional email hooks and Redux cart slice to keep UI state aligned with backend writes.

### Todo App · Stage 3B · Expo/React Native/Convex
- Delivered real-time task syncing using Convex live queries on web, iOS, and Android.
- Gesture-handler + Reanimated provide drag-and-drop sorting, swipe actions, and subtle haptics.
- Offline queue retries writes automatically when the network reconnects.

### Framez Social App · Stage 4+ · Expo Router/Supabase
- Built authenticated feed with media uploads, likes, comments, and push notifications.
- Enforced Supabase row-level security and storage rules to protect user-generated content.
- Implemented infinite scroll that preloads the next batch for perceived instant loading.

## Process & Collaboration
- Start with desired user outcome, design the primary flow, then translate it into a lean architecture.
- Encode accessibility from day zero: semantic structure, labeled controls, skip navigation, focus traps.
- Treat performance budgets as non-negotiable—monitor bundle size, image weight, and network waterfalls.

## Education & Community
- HNG Internship (2024) – Frontend & Mobile specialization.
- Volunteer mentor for junior developers focusing on web accessibility and design systems.
